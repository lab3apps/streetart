			<h1 class="logo-header">Logo Competition Gallery</h1>
			<p class="logo-intro">Over a four week period, we ran a logo design competition to find Watch This Space a logo. We received a range of entries from designers to street artists to students. We had a solid representation from the local audience, received many from designers passing through New Zealand, and received ones from as far away as Japan and Saudi Arabia. Many of the entrants are currently studying or emerging professionals, looking to build their portfolio. We want to acknowledge the time, effort, and creativity they put into their designs, so we'd like to share them all with you.<br><br>If you find something you like, please contact us. We'd be more than happy to get you in touch with the designer.<br><br>Our winning logo comes from artist and designer, James Ford. He is originally from the UK, and now resides in Wellington. His logo caught our eye immediately when it came in. It’s straight to the point and anyone who sees it will immediately understand what we do.<br><br>We'd also like to give a shout out to Josiah Rees and Declan Podmore. Josiah is a first year graphic design student at Ara Institute. His designs and their professionalism caught the eye of everyone in our panel, so we've gotten in contact with Josiah, and he will be making some future adverts for us. Declan is a graphic design student at YOOBEE. We're using part of his logo for the icons in our interactive map. We’ve also asked Declan to make an advert that other websites and organisations can use when they share our website.<br><br>Thank you to everyone who took the time to enter our contest. You can check out the 50 plus logos here, and if you have any words of encouragement or praise for the designer, please contact us. I'm sure they'd love to hear from you.</p>
